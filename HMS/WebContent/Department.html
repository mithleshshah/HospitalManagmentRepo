<b>Accident and emergency (A&E)</b>
</br>
This department (sometimes called Casualty) is where you're likely to be taken if you've called an ambulance in an emergency.

It's also where you should come if you've had an accident, but can make your own way to hospital.
</br>
These departments operate 24 hours a day, every day and are staffed and equipped to deal with all emergencies.

</br>
It has a relatively small number of beds and is manned by specialist doctors and nurses, as well as by consultant anaesthetists, physiotherapists and dietitians.

</br>
Many hospitals now have discharge lounges to help your final day in hospital go smoothly.
</br>
Patients who don't need to stay on the ward are transferred to the lounge on the day of discharge. Staff will inform the pharmacy, transport and relatives of your transfer.
